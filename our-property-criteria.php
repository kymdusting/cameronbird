            <h2>Our Property Criteria</h2>
            <h3>Cash flow positive</h3>
            <p>Cash flow positive properties give you more money in your pocket at the end of each financial year by offsetting your acquisition costs with the rental income and tax advantages available for investment properties.</p>
            <h3>Capital growth potential</h3>
<p>Achieving solid wealth creation is only possible when you invest in properties with high potential for capital growth - particularly, if like many of our clients, you can accumulate multiple properties achieving strong growth.</p>
<h3>Location, rental returns and depreciation allowances</h3>
<p>A property with scope for capital gain must be in a unique location, rents must increase faster than inflation, strong capital gain factors must be present and it must be dripping in depreciation allowances.</p>
<h3>Prices not available to the general public</h3>
<p>We travel a lot, and assess many properties, but insist that any properties we recommend to our Subscribers must sell at or below bank valuation. It never ceases to amaze us how many people pay too much for their real estate!</p>
<h3>Exclusive sources</h3>
<p>We have extensive contacts in the industry. Usually the properties we list are not available elsewhere in the marketplace. You can only find them through us.</p>
<h3>Knowing when to say "NO"</h3>
<p>As you might expect, with such tough criteria we rule out about 95% of the properties we inspect. We wouldn't be in business if we were willing to offer less than excellent opportunities to our clients.</p>
