                <p>2015 brings out our strongest release in 3 years.</p>
                <p>9.7% projected population growth each year, every year, until the year 2036! To have an almost double digit projection for the next 21 years is quite remarkable. Population on this scale, with its phenomenally low age demographic really does point to sustainable growth for this rea. With the Coomera Town Centre approvals in place, we are eagerly awaiting the announcement of the catalyst upgrade of EXIT 54 for the domino effect to take place. To have 34 hectares of land surrounded by 3 rapidly growing suburbs... it's only a matter of time.</p>
