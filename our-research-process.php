    <li>We consider local, state and federal government policies and their potential influences.</li>
    <li>We travel, consult, analyse and draw on our experience as we forecast.</li>
    <li>We have established long-term relationships with property developers who can consistently provide us with the stock that meets our criteria.</li>
    <li>We check every stakeholder's credentials.</li>
